Made as submission for the Patient Safety Technology Challenge at HopHacks (Johns Hopkins University)
Winner - 1st place

We built SurgiScan using the YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once) object detection model, training it on a custom dataset of surgical tools. We utilized OpenCV for image processing and developed a framework to track each tool during its use, providing visual feedback to the surgical team.
